# Decision Tree Classification

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Decision Tree Classification as part of the CPCS-331 Artificial Intelligence course. The task involves building a decision tree, calculating entropy and information gain, extracting rules, and classifying a testing dataset.

## **Features**
- Calculation of entropy and information gain for dataset features.
- Decision tree construction using the ID3 algorithm.
- Visualization of the decision tree.
- Extraction of classification rules.
- Testing dataset classification with detailed reasoning for each prediction.

## **Dataset**
The training dataset contains the following features:
- `age`
- `income`
- `student`
- `credit_rating`
- `buys_computer` (target variable)

## **Usage**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classification.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the code to:
   - Train the decision tree.
   - Visualize the tree and extract rules.
   - Classify testing data.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
